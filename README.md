# MyCookBook
-find your favorite book and its reviews, by John Sujith
Project Purpose:
Bookfinder is simple website that uses the google books api database to look up book information. It FEATURES things like the name of the book , book image , year it was written , rating of the book and link to where buy the book.

Original Stretch Goals:
Recommendations Create recommendations for other books based on the title they choose. More about the author of the book and his other book works. And also worldwide sales of the book.

Project Questions:

The hardest part of this project was to link the API readings with the buy button. With the help of Brian i was able to solve this problem. The other problem i had was with the media query for the iphone. i was able to finish it but there is a lot of bugs left to fix. This took a lot of problem solving and just playing aroung with the divs to figure some of this out. Im overall proud of my first project and its functionality. i cant wait to improve on my coding skills and work on more stuff.
